Additionally 'they will not be stopping any tracks that Audible Magic fails to recognize, nor will they be resticting traffic using unrecognized protocols.' Sounds pretty good to me.</p>\n<p>Importantly, the file sharing is allowed in any format, and includes deleted material, so your files need not be hampered by any of that DRM nonsense. +1 for a decent licensing model that keeps customers happy, also makes money.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Legal P2P, Finally...","date":null,"read":null,"image":{"childImageSharp":{"sizes":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":1.5,"src":"/static/fe41991fff7a0e140d1f9c77ea8022b9/30037/tokyo.jpg","srcSet":"/static/fe41991fff7a0e140d1f9c77ea8022b9/10bdc/tokyo.jpg 158w,\n/static/fe41991fff7a0e140d1f9c77ea8022b9/f4ab0/tokyo.jpg 315w,\n/static/fe41991fff7a0e140d1f9c77ea8022b9/30037/tokyo.jpg 630w,\n/static/fe41991fff7a0e140d1f9c77ea8022b9/9810d/tokyo.jpg 945w,\n/static/fe41991fff7a0e140d1f9c77ea8022b9/ff2e4/tokyo.jpg 1260w,\n/static/fe41991fff7a0e140d1f9c77ea8022b9/bab44/tokyo.jpg 6240w","sizes":"(max-width: 630px) 100vw, 630px"}}}}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/blogs/2005-08-23-legal-p2p-finally/"}}}
