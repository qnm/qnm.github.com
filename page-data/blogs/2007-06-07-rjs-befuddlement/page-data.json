As someone who codes in PHP for their day job, Rails provides me a wonderful example of how to do things properly. Everything feels nice, and many things are simple to implement, but for this little RJS problem I have is driving me crazy.</p>\n<p><strong>Why, oh, why do my RJS templates not always run as RJS when they should?\n</strong>\nI have an action method named test<em>attending, and an RJS template named test</em>attending.rjs. Everything works as you would expect - the action runs and the RJS template executes correctly. However, if I change the name of the method and template <strong><em>in any way</em></strong>, the whole thing fails to work. The controller looks to load attendin.rhtml, but that doesn't exist. Nightmare! I've even tried using the responds_to method, but to no avail. Why does changing the method name break everything?</p>\n<p>As if to add insult to injury, it looks like I'm not able to run the UJS plugin either. Having installed the plugin and called the rake task, adding the UJS::routes method call to routes.rb causes what we in PHP land would call a Fat Al - a server 500.</p>\n<p>I love Rails, and I'm finding it so easy to implement my new project in Rails that I wanna keep going, but these two little issues are dragging me down. What am I doing wrong, people?</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"RJS befuddlement","date":null,"read":null,"image":{"childImageSharp":{"sizes":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":1.5,"src":"/static/fe41991fff7a0e140d1f9c77ea8022b9/30037/tokyo.jpg","srcSet":"/static/fe41991fff7a0e140d1f9c77ea8022b9/10bdc/tokyo.jpg 158w,\n/static/fe41991fff7a0e140d1f9c77ea8022b9/f4ab0/tokyo.jpg 315w,\n/static/fe41991fff7a0e140d1f9c77ea8022b9/30037/tokyo.jpg 630w,\n/static/fe41991fff7a0e140d1f9c77ea8022b9/9810d/tokyo.jpg 945w,\n/static/fe41991fff7a0e140d1f9c77ea8022b9/ff2e4/tokyo.jpg 1260w,\n/static/fe41991fff7a0e140d1f9c77ea8022b9/bab44/tokyo.jpg 6240w","sizes":"(max-width: 630px) 100vw, 630px"}}}}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/blogs/2007-06-07-rjs-befuddlement/"}}}
