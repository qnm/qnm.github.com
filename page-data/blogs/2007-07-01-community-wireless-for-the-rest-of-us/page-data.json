Both of these systems have merit, but the barrier to entry is the same for both - you must use hardware to make the community happen.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.whisher.com\">Whisher</a> is different - there is no hardware to buy, as the community part is implemented through software. How so? You run a client on your chosen platform (Whisher is available for Windows, Mac and even Linux) and give it the credentials to connect to your home network. The Whisher client knows how to connect to many wireless networks, and everyone who shares can connect to any other Whisher users' share.</p>\n<p>I'm now sharing, and I'd encourage others to do so. I'd love to have wireless available wherever I am, and this is such a simple way to do that everyone should try it!</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Community wireless for the rest of us","date":null,"read":null,"image":{"childImageSharp":{"sizes":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":1.5,"src":"/static/fe41991fff7a0e140d1f9c77ea8022b9/30037/tokyo.jpg","srcSet":"/static/fe41991fff7a0e140d1f9c77ea8022b9/10bdc/tokyo.jpg 158w,\n/static/fe41991fff7a0e140d1f9c77ea8022b9/f4ab0/tokyo.jpg 315w,\n/static/fe41991fff7a0e140d1f9c77ea8022b9/30037/tokyo.jpg 630w,\n/static/fe41991fff7a0e140d1f9c77ea8022b9/9810d/tokyo.jpg 945w,\n/static/fe41991fff7a0e140d1f9c77ea8022b9/ff2e4/tokyo.jpg 1260w,\n/static/fe41991fff7a0e140d1f9c77ea8022b9/bab44/tokyo.jpg 6240w","sizes":"(max-width: 630px) 100vw, 630px"}}}}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/blogs/2007-07-01-community-wireless-for-the-rest-of-us/"}}}
