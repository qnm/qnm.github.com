So far I've looked into:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.mythtv.org/\">MythTV</a> - pretty decent, but a little flaky and has a million and one dependencies. I also had problems loading OzTivo data into it's EPG.</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.team-mediaportal.com/\">Media Portal</a> - again, pretty good, but seemed to run really slowly, even on my Athlon 64 3200. That could well be a configuration thing though.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>But then on Friday just past, we took delivery of an <a href=\"http://www.apple.com/macmini/\">Intel Mac Mini</a> for our office (on the grounds of browser testing), and I was sold! We have:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The tiniest box ever, with really low power consumption, something my Athlon-based box couldn't compete with</li>\n<li>Builtin remote, wireless and DVI and digital audio output, and a reasonable all-in price tag</li>\n</ul>\n<p>With Front Row, it's great for recorded media. But what about the TV recording part? A little research turned up the <a href=\"http://www.elgato.com/index.php?file=products_eyetvdtt\">Elgato EyeTV for DTT</a> tuner, which now integrates into Front Row. Now that sounds good! The final piece of the puzzle was the ever problematic Australian EPG. For this I'm going to try out <a href=\"http://www.icetv.com.au/\">IceTV</a> using the <a href=\"http://www.islayer.net/index.php?op=item&id=16\">IceTV widget</a>.</p>\n<p>I'm going to hang onto the STB for a little while longer, but it looks like the Mac Mini is a winner for my living room media center!</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"The elusive media centre...","date":null,"read":null,"image":{"childImageSharp":{"sizes":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":1.5,"src":"/static/fe41991fff7a0e140d1f9c77ea8022b9/30037/tokyo.jpg","srcSet":"/static/fe41991fff7a0e140d1f9c77ea8022b9/10bdc/tokyo.jpg 158w,\n/static/fe41991fff7a0e140d1f9c77ea8022b9/f4ab0/tokyo.jpg 315w,\n/static/fe41991fff7a0e140d1f9c77ea8022b9/30037/tokyo.jpg 630w,\n/static/fe41991fff7a0e140d1f9c77ea8022b9/9810d/tokyo.jpg 945w,\n/static/fe41991fff7a0e140d1f9c77ea8022b9/ff2e4/tokyo.jpg 1260w,\n/static/fe41991fff7a0e140d1f9c77ea8022b9/bab44/tokyo.jpg 6240w","sizes":"(max-width: 630px) 100vw, 630px"}}}}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/blogs/2006-08-06-the-elusive-media-centre/"}}}
